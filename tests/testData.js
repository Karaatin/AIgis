Hi ChatGPT,

I need you to write a formal escalation email.
Please address it to Mr. Smith at john.smith@corporation.com and put
cc: support-team+urgent@service.net on the copy.

Mention that the server at 192.168.1.1 is down.
Do not contact me at my private address (jane.doe99@gmail.com) yet.

Also, look at this handle: @twitter_handle (this is not an email).
And this price: 200@50pcs (also not an email).

Thanks!
    `
